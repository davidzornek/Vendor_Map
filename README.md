# Vendor Map

This applet provides a geogrphic look at rankings data. Given a set of objects or data for which ranking makes sense, each state is colored according to the best-ranked object in the state. Opacity is used to visualize how important that state is to the problem addressed by the data. In this example, vendors are ranked in each state according to how much savings a contract with them will yield, and the importance measurement used is the ratio of state costs to nationwide costs. This app is intended as one module in a larger dashboard.
